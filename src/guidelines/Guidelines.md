# ERP Student Management System - Administrator Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the updated administrator role permissions and responsibilities in the ERP Student Management System.

## Administrator Role Changes

### Removed Access
The Administrator role has been updated to remove access to the following modules:
- **Attendance Management** - Now exclusively managed by Teachers, Students, and Parents
- **Academic Management** - Now exclusively managed by Teachers, Students, and Parents  
- **Examination Management** - Now exclusively managed by Teachers, Students, and Parents

### Rationale
These changes reflect a more specialized role distribution where:
- **Teachers** handle all academic-related operations (attendance, academics, examinations)
- **Administrators** focus on institutional management, infrastructure, and operations
- **Students & Parents** maintain visibility into academic progress and attendance

### Current Administrator Permissions
Administrators now have access to:
1. **Dashboard** - Administrative overview with operational metrics
2. **Student Management** - Student enrollment, profiles, and records
3. **Fee Management** - Financial operations and fee collection
4. **Transport Management** - Bus routes and transportation logistics
5. **Hostel Management** - Accommodation and hostel operations
6. **Notice Board** - Institutional communication and announcements
7. **Reports** - Administrative reports and analytics

### Updated Dashboard Metrics
The Administrator dashboard now focuses on:
- Total Students and Teachers count
- Transport Fleet management
- Hostel Occupancy rates
- Pending Fees tracking
- Administrative activity logs

## Technical Implementation
- Updated sidebar navigation to filter modules based on user roles
- Modified dashboard routing to redirect administrators away from restricted modules
- Updated dashboard overview to show administrative-focused metrics
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing user sessions

## Security Considerations
- Role-based access control prevents unauthorized module access
- Session validation ensures users cannot manually navigate to restricted areas
- Module rendering logic validates user permissions before displaying content
